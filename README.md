### Predicting Ad Click Fraud:  Machine Learning Predictive Analysis Using Azure ML and Databricks Spark ML
Introduction to Big Data Science Project


## Overview

The goal of our project is to predict whether a user will download an app after clicking on a mobile app ad in order to better target the ads to the audience, to avoid fraudulent practices and save money. 


### DATASET:

The original dataset from Kaggle contains 200 million clicks over 4-day period provided by TalkingData.

TalkingData is Chinaâ€™s largest independent big data service platform:
* covers over 70% of active mobile devices nationwide 
* handles 3 billion clicks per day
* 90% of which are potentially fraudulent

Since the original dataset is over 7GB in size we have implemented a Python code to reduce the size to 1GB in order to be able to run the models in Azure ML and Databricks Spark ML.
